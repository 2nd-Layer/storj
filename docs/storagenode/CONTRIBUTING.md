## Quick contribution tips and guidelines

### Pull requests are always welcome

To encourage active collaboration, pull requests are strongly encouraged, not just bug reports.

We accept pull requests for bug fixes and features where we've discussed the approach in an issue and given the go-ahead for a community member to work on it.

"Bug reports" may also be sent in the form of a pull request containing a failing test. We'd also love to hear about ideas for new features as issues.

Please do:

* Check existing issues to verify that the bug or feature request has not already been submitted.
* Open an issue if things aren't working as expected.
* Open an issue to propose a significant change.
* open an issue to propose a feature
* Open a pull request to fix a bug.
* Open a pull request for an issue with the [`SNO`](https://github.com/storj/storj/labels/SNO) and [`Help Wanted`](https://github.com/storj/storj/labels/Help%20Wanted) or [`Good first issue`](https://github.com/storj/storj/labels/Good%20First%20Issue) label and leave a comment claiming it.

Please avoid:

* Opening pull requests for issues marked `Need Design`, `Need Investigation`, `Waiting For Feedback` or `Blocked`.
* opening pull requests that are not related to any open issue unless they are bug reports in the form pull requests containing failing tests.

Please note that this project adheres to a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/storj/storj/tree/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.
